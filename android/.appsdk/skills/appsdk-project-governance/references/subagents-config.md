# Persistent subworkers and shared policy

This reference describes the persistent **subworker** policy. The `[subagent]`
tables and `appsdk-subagent` MCP name are compatibility protocol tokens. They
do not mean that Codex Desktop should use a native task/thread spawn command.

Only `~/.appsdk/config.toml` owns startup/notification/timer policy. Run
`appsdk config` from the project cwd to validate and inspect effective values.
Global defaults work when the file is absent; project overrides stay in
`[[projects]]` tables in that same file. Git worktrees inherit their main
project's policy. Never copy Codex credentials or rewrite its profiles.

```toml
[notifications]
enabled = true
mode = "batch" # immediate or batch
batch_window_seconds = 60
transport = "appserver"
submit_enter = true
[notifications.events.deadline]
mode = "immediate"
[timers]
enabled = true
tick_interval_ms = 1000
[keepalive]
enabled = true
interval_seconds = 900 # minimum 15 minutes
max_unacked = 3 # legacy delivery throttle; recv consumes notifications
[subagent]
profile_priority = ["gcm", "oauth"]
persistent = true
close_on_task_complete = false
[subagent.profiles.gcm]
codex_profile = "gcm"
[subagent.profiles.oauth]
codex_profile = "oauth"
model = "gpt-5.6-luna"
[subagent.health]
timeout_seconds = 45
attempts_per_profile = 1
expected_response = "OK"
[subagent.startup]
ready_timeout_seconds = 90
# Optional:

# root = "/absolute/project/root"
# [projects.notifications]
# mode = "immediate"
```

Event keys: `direct_message`, `resource_released`, `async_result`, `deadline`;
each accepts `mode = "inherit" | "immediate" | "batch"`. A fixed batch window
does not slide when new messages arrive. Disabled timers suppress deadline
notification generation, not task timeout safety checks. New subworkers read
config at creation; existing daemons read policy at startup. Use controlled
daemon restart after a policy change. Existing tasks/mailboxes remain intact.

From a registered Codex App Server parent:

```text
appsdk subworker start --id <unique-request-id>
appsdk subworker list
appsdk subworker status <id>
appsdk subworker snapshot <id> --lines 40
appsdk subworker send <id> --subject <topic> "<task>"
appsdk subworker close <id>
```

`start` probes each configured profile once, bounded by timeout, then launches
one Codex session. Reusing an ID returns the existing record, never restarts
it. `starting` is not `idle`: Codex may require trust/auth/approval interaction.
Use status; do not inject automatic confirmation or keep re-sending tasks.
All profiles failing returns a failed record with reasons and no launch.

An already trusted cwd and healthy authenticated profile should start without
new trust/auth interaction. Repeated prompts on that path are a startup bug,
not an instruction to reinitialize credentials or accept prompts automatically.

## Finite task keepalive and observation

`send` creates the canonical `task-<message-id>` task in the Collab task list.
Child `working` claims it; bind code work with `collab_task_relocate`, not a
duplicate task registration. Complete the real task lifecycle; `ready` changes
session availability only and never marks unfinished tasks complete.

Unfinished actionable tasks are grouped by worker. Explicit idle for 15 minutes
allows one activation. Read the notification with `collab recv`; reading consumes
it atomically, so a normal follow-up ACK is not required. Messages sent by the
worker and positive working observations count as activity. Unknown remains
unknown; absent/unknown/working receive no activation. Blocked/waiting tasks
follow their declared wait, not this continuation path.

Three consecutive unconfirmed attempts exhaust the durable budget. After the
third response window, status marks `suspected_offline`; it does not claim the
process is dead. Failed/uncertain sends count, restart does not reset the budget,
and no process is respawned. Only an explicit parent/operator request may use
`appsdk subworker rearm <id>`; never rearm automatically to bypass exhaustion.

`status` returns observed state, task list, parent mailbox, keepalive counters
and notification/ACK history. `snapshot` is optional diagnostic output only;
it never sends a notice or becomes task/control truth. Snapshot may contain
sensitive output: request only when relevant, do not republish it by default.

An agent without a live App Server native thread may use local project
`list/status/snapshot` without registering a fake peer. Initialization and
queries explicitly report `notification_channel: none`: no push channel exists
for that observer. Check the mailbox in `status` yourself; do not wait for an
automatic completion notification. This is not a quality gate or a reason to
stop independent work. Mutating parent operations retain authenticated
ownership checks.

The child uses the injected `appsdk-subagent` MCP: `collab_init`, then
`collab_subagent` with `action=ready, id=<id>`. The launcher forwards the live
Codex App Server native-thread binding automatically; do not ask the user to
set environment variables. Use MCP, not sandboxed shell registration. Only its
bound identity may report ready. It accepts a dispatched task with `action=working`, manages its
own task/worktree lifecycle, sends results to the parent, and calls `ready`
when done. Repeated idle reports are no-ops. Remain idle, not an ACK/poll loop.
Task progress stays in Collab task records; no second task queue exists here.

Only the creating parent may send/close; a user-requested early close may
interrupt work, but never deletes worktrees or marks tasks complete. Closing
uses the exact registered peer identity. It does not stop the project daemon.
Daemon restart replays records without automatically respawning or redispatching.
If startup was interrupted, preserve the record/session and inspect status;
do not reuse its ID to create another process.

Upgrade: install reviewed Collab and AppSDK releases, then `collab down` /
`collab up` per already-running project. No migration/reset/init of old tasks
is required. Preserve journals and running subworker sessions. Do not downgrade
to an older reader after new subworker events have been written to the journal.
